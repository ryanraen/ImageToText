# InstantOCR

## What does it do?

This application will extract text from images containing plain text using simple *Optical Character Recognition* (OCR) logic. The user is able to select any image from ```data/images``` and perform the conversion process on it.

## Who will use it?

The tool is designed for:
- **Students** who need to extract text from images.
- **Professionals** who need to digitalize *printed text*.
- My own personal use.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

The idea first entered my mind back in November, 2024. While formatting my discrete mathematics assignment into LaTeX, I ran into many issues with losing my progress since the assignment platform saved LaTeX entries as whole images, which could not be altered in fragments. Frankly, the frustration of repeatedly losing my work made me want to pull my hair out. Since most 'image to LaTeX' tools require a fee to use, the thought of creating my own deeply rooted in the back of my mind.

Recognizing the limitations of my current skill and knowledge, I will begin with something simpler: an application that extracts plain text of a certain font from images. In the future, I hope to take my application further and integrate support for other common fonts and eventually allow for conversion from formatted LaTeX to code.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to select an image from a predefined set of images files stored within the project data and add it as a new image conversion instance within my conversion history.
- As a user, I want to have the application recognize and gather plain text from within the image so that I can extract the text in a usuable format.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of the image conversions that I have executed previously, so I can keep track of all the images Iâ€™ve processed.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove an image conversion from my conversion history.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a certain image conversion and retrieve the image's file path and the extracted text from that instance.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my conversion history to file if I choose to do so
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my conversion history from file if I choose to do so
